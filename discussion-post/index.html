A group of American auto CEOs take a trip to a Japanese auto manufacturing plant to see how their building processes differ from ours. In America, there's a guy who takes a rubber mallet to the doors of the car after they are attached to the body to make sure it’s a snug fit and will close properly. In Japan, this particular job seemed to be absent. When the American CEOs asked their Japanese guide why this is, he said “we make sure the doors fit when we design them.” This is such a great lesson that can be applied to all sorts of fields, but art and design is an obvious one. </p><picture>

<h2>Response 1 </h2><p>Awesome insight Sara, if you read my post you'll see I struggle with a lot of the same things. Jumping right into a project isn't always a bad thing, in my opinion. While I could use paper and pencil more to explore ideas and relationships between objects in order to create balance and focus, I do tend to gravitate towards my computer on the front end. But that's because I know myself well. I know for a fact that I can draw things out in Illustrator faster than it would take me just to pull out paper and pencil, let alone sketch anything. I usually have an artboard named "scratchpad" where I doodle, collect images, etc, that I can iterate on and pull into different documents. Keeping the focus on big objects, however, is a struggle.
While I don't think that there are rules or a formula for great design, you're spot on in thinking that it's incredibly analytical. I'm an artistic person—I love color, crazy patterns, I play music, I write, I practice photography, but when it comes to design work I usually tell people that I'm closer to an engineer than I am to an artist. Creating relevant design is a puzzle and it's the designer's job to solve it. How do I create a logo that sums up a company in a small pictograph? What two font families should I mix for the best readability on screen and in print, while still respecting the company’s heritage? Is this person the right model for the people I’m trying to reach?  Will this look as good in black and white as it does in color? Is this going to scale across devices properly or should I rethink the flow of my layout? Who’s my target market, how old are they, what’s their income, where do they live, how do they see the world, and how can I get their attention? Design is art, definitely, but it’s art with constraints and goals. We have to live in those constraints, embrace that tension, in order to do our jobs well—that alone is an art in of itself.</p></div></section></div><section id="3" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ls-p-h-2vw  colors-white colors-global " data-reactid="23"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ls-bd-r ls-bd-w-1" data-reactid="24"><div class="Group Group-heading ls-p-r-4" data-reactid="25"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="26"><span data-reactid="27"><!-- react-empty: 28 --><h2 data-reactid="29"><a data-reactid="30">gridtest2</a></h2></span></div></div></div><div class="fx-1" data-reactid="31"><div class="Group Group--links" data-reactid="32"><div class="Group Group--links f-s-m ls-f-s-s w-s-wrap ls-w-s-nowrap" data-reactid="33"></div></div></div><div data-reactid="34"></div></section></div></div>
