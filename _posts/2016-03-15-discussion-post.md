# Discussion Post 

This is a great prompt, Isaiah, it's making me think. This is the area of design in which I tend to work harder and not smarter. Thumbnail sketches and the like always take a backseat in my process because I get so focused on the minutiae of a project. I put horses before the carts (no pun intended) and often begin with questions centered around color, details, typography, etc. when I should begin with general form and negative space. I feel like I sometimes start with the wrong questions and quickly become frustrated with the results. I also tend to scrap any sketches I begin with because I cannot wholly realize my idea. As a result, I often start at the computer and begin iterating on ideas over and over again until I reach something I'm satisfied with. There's nothing wrong with that, per se, as I eventually come to a resolution. But I know that I could start with paper (or digital paper) and pencil to begin my creative process with much more freedom and fluidity, hashing out what works and what doesn't before I even touch my computer and spend needless time tweaking things. Some things, of course, need to simply be tested and tried over and over again until it looks "right" to the eye and not just in concept or in principle.

Awesome insight Sara, if you read my post you'll see I struggle with a lot of the same things. Jumping right into a project isn't always a bad thing, in my opinion. While I could use paper and pencil more to explore ideas and relationships between objects in order to create balance and focus, I do tend to gravitate towards my computer on the front end. But that's because I know myself well. I know for a fact that I can draw things out in Illustrator faster than it would take me just to pull out paper and pencil, let alone sketch anything. I usually have an artboard named "scratchpad" where I doodle, collect images, etc, that I can iterate on and pull into different documents. Keeping the focus on big objects, however, is a struggle.
While I don't think that there are rules or a formula for great design, you're spot on in thinking that it's incredibly analytical. I'm an artistic person---I love color, crazy patterns, I play music, I write, I practice photography, but when it comes to design work I usually tell people that I'm closer to an engineer than I am to an artist. Creating relevant design is a puzzle and it's the designer's job to solve it. How do I create a logo that sums up a company in a small pictograph? What two font families should I mix for the best readability on screen and in print, while still respecting the company's heritage? Is this person the right model for the people I'm trying to reach? Will this look as good in black and white as it does in color? Is this going to scale across devices properly or should I rethink the flow of my layout? Who's my target market, how old are they, what's their income, where do they live, how do they see the world, and how can I get their attention? Design is art, definitely, but it's art with constraints and goals. We have to live in those constraints, embrace that tension, in order to do our jobs well---that alone is an art in of itself.
