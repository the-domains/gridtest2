Jumping right into a project isn&#x27;t always a bad thing, in my opinion. While I could use paper and pencil more to explore ideas and relationships between objects in order to create balance and focus, I do tend to gravitate towards my computer on the front end. But that&#x27;s because I know myself well. I know for a fact that I can draw things out in Illustrator faster than it would take me just to pull out paper and pencil, let alone sketch anything. I usually have an artboard named &quot;scratchpad&quot; where I doodle, collect images, etc, that I can iterate on and pull into different documents. Keeping the focus on big objects, however, is a struggle.
While I don&#x27;t think that there are rules or a formula for great design, you&#x27;re spot on in thinking that it&#x27;s incredibly analytical. I&#x27;m an artistic person—I love color, crazy patterns, I play music, I write, I practice photography, but when it comes to design work I usually tell people that I&#x27;m closer to an engineer than I am to an artist. Creating relevant design is a puzzle and it&#x27;s the designer&#x27;s job to solve it. How do I create a logo that sums up a company in a small pictograph? What two font families should I mix for the best readability on screen and in print, while still respecting the company’s heritage? Is this person the right model for the people I’m trying to reach?  Will this look as good in black and white as it does in color? Is this going to scale across devices properly or should I rethink the flow of my layout? Who’s my target market, how old are they, what’s their income, where do they live, how do they see the world, and how can I get their attention? Design is art, definitely, but it’s art with constraints and goals. We have to live in those constraints, embrace that tension, in order to do our jobs well—that alone is an art in of itself.</p></div></div></div></section><section id="3" class="Section Section--components-1 color-title title-size-medium p-0 ls-p-h-13vw ls-p-v-8  color-bg text-align-left  colors-white colors-global " data-reactid="40"><div class="Component fx-c a-i-center p-1 " data-reactid="41"><div class="Group Group--column min-w-240px p-1 max-w-768px m-a" data-reactid="42"><!-- react-empty: 43 --><div class="System-font  Headline" data-reactid="44"><h1 data-reactid="45"><span class=" color-box-pop" data-reactid="46"><a class="font-title" data-reactid="47">Proportion vs. Scale </a></span></h1></div><!-- react-empty: 48 --><!-- react-empty: 49 --><div class="Paragraph" data-reactid="50"><p data-reactid="51"> The space shuttle itself becomes very passive, or active, in the image depending on how these proportional relationships are presented.

The digital tools we use give us incredible power over perception and focus, and the picture of the tilt-shifted space shuttle is a perfect example of that. I can utilize scale to shift the focus of a piece between two objects, or even affect the implications of a piece. Imagine if the weather-worn space shuttle in the post-apocalyptic photo was much, much smaller—made to look like an old toy left behind by a child instead of a monument left behind by an entire civilization. Perhaps the rider in that piece would have no reason to pause, therefore becoming the focus of the image instead of the shuttle.
